;;; Riddle: Youâ€™ve got the first 6 digits 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.
;;;
;;; You have to partition the digits into 3 numbers x, y and z where:
;;;
;;; x is a 3-digit number
;;; y is a 2-digit number
;;; z is a single digit number
;;; Such that the multiplication x*y*z is maximal.

;;; example by Yehonathan Sharvit, but obviously doesn't return x,y,z?  Must have been an
;;; editing error.

;;; Of course, it is inefficient to generate and test all the permutations.  As we're trying
;;; to maximize the product, you need to maximize the factors.  So the biggest digit goes to
;;; the highest places, smaller factor, first.  Well, not so obvious, when you get to the
;;; tens places.  You have to allocate 6, 5y, 4xx first.  Then decide the 3 has to go in the
;;; 10x, and the 2 goes to the y, because???  Leaving the 1 for x.  Something like that.  I
;;; guess you do need to generate and test a bit.


;;; INCOMPLETE reasoning...

;;; The right way to do it would be to write out the long multiplication calculations by
;;; digit.
