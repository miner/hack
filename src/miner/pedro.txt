My Rules of Pedro

I learned what Wikipedia calls "California Pedro" which is apparently a variation of Italian
Pedro.  My Dad said is was a Portuguese card game.  He was taught by another teacher, Joe
Villa.

Rules -- my version is known as "California Pedro", which comes from the Italian variant,
although I learned it as a Portuguese game.  Wikipedia says it's aka "Cinch", derived from
"All Fours" or "Auction Pitch".

"California" Pedro
Miner House Rules

standard pack of 52 cards
2x2 partners
trick-taking game

point cards (in trump suit)
  Ace, Ten, Two -- 1 point each
  Jack -- 3 points
  Pedro (Five) and off-Pedro (other Five) -- 5 points each

Other cards do not score, but ranks matter for winning tricks.

Cards are ranked from Ace high, down to 2 low in the usual order.

The off-Pedro is the 5 of the same color as the declared trump suit.  Its rank is just
below the trump suit 5.  The off-Pedro is considered a trump card.

The 2 of trump automatically wins itself so whoever plays it, keeps it (worth 1 point).
Other cards are taken by the highest trump card played in the trick.

First dealer is decided by cutting.

Dealer deals nine cards to each player, three at a time.

Bidding starts with player to the left of the dealer and proceeds once around the table.
You may bid higher than current bid or pass.  Mininum 6.  If no one bids, the dealer must
bid 6.  Max bid is 16 but if you succeed, you actually get 32 points as a bonus.

Highest bidder declares the trump suit.  All players must discard their non-trump cards.
Remember, the off-Pedro counts as trump.

Dealer gives other players extra cards as needed to total six.

The dealer may select from all remaining cards to get to his six.  He must keep all trump cards
even if he ends up with more than six cards.

If insufficient cards remain, the discard pile is recycled.

The first trick is led by the bidder.  He must lead with a trump card.

If a trump card is played first in a trick, everyone else must play a trump card if they
have one.  If you don't have a trump card, then you can play anything.

You can always play a trump card.  Otherwise, you should follow the suit of the first card
of the trick.  If you don't have that suit, you can play any card.

If a player has extra trump, he plays an extra non-point trump card at the end of a trick
until he gets back to normal.

The trick is won by the highest trump played.  If no trumps, then the highest card of the
lead suit wins.

The winner of a trick leads the next trick.  He can lead with any card.

At the end of the round, add up your team's scoring cards.  If the bidder makes his bid, his team
scores those points.  If they fail to keep their contract, they lose points equal to the
bid.  The non-bidder keeps his points.

Play to 91.  You must be the bidder to win.  If both teams get to 91 or higher,
the bidder is the winner.  If the non-bidder gets to 91, play continues.

Dealership rotates clockwise.



STRATEGY

Bidders typically have an Ace or several high cards.  Hopefully, the partner will have a
Pedro.  It's relatively easy to get 6 points if you start with an Ace and a few trump cards.
With an Ace and a Jack, you might bid 9 points.  Of course, more trump cards are better.

You will want to keep track of who played which trump cards in previous tricks.  It's a good
indicator of what they have left.

Try to play your Pedro when your partner has already played an Ace (or the highest remaining
trump card).

If you have the high cards, try to keep the lead and play them in order.  Sometimes you can
force your opponents to give up their Pedros.

If you have a higher card than the leader, play it to allow your partner to play a Pedro.

If you're the last player and everyone has played off-trump, you can win your Pedro with
itself.  The third player should try to prevent this by playing a trump instead of staying
off-trump.






EXTRA RULES

Partners are not allowed to collude.  Cards should be kept secret until played.

Discards are face up.  If someone accidentally discards trump, any player may claim it
before the dealer asks to complete hands.  For beginners, we simply tell them to take back
their trump cards rather than letting other players grab them.

Sometimes we allow "Shoot the Moon".  The bidder must win all 16 points, in which case they
win the game immediately, otherwise they lose.
