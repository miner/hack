;; Eric's Challenge
;; Wolf-Sheep-Cabbage puzzle
;;

;; You own a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage. You need to cross a river and you only have a
;; boat big enough for you plus one other passenger (your wolf, sheep, or cabbage). The
;; trouble is, the animals are hungry. If you leave the wolf with the sheep, the wolf will
;; eat it. If you leave the sheep with the cabbage, it will eat it. The wolf, being a
;; carnivore, will not eat the cabbage. How do you move them safely to the other side with
;; nothing being eaten?
;;
;; Your task is to write a function that generates solutions to this puzzle, in the form of
;; boat crossings. Each crossing should state: the direction you are going, and the
;; passenger in your boat.  Bonus: Write a function that validates a solution.

;; (defn wolf-sheep-cabbage []) => ([...
;;                                  {:direction :across
;;                                   :passenger :cabbage}
;;                                  {:direction :return
;;                                   :passenger :sheep}]
;;                                 ...)

;; inital state:  W S C b ---  [empty]
;; :across S,   W C --- b S
;; :return nil, W C b --- S
;;:across C,  W --- b C S
;; :return S,  W S b --- C
;; :across W,  S -- b W C
;; :return nil, S b -- W C
;; :across S, [empty] -- b S W C


;; Assume You and Boat are always together.  The animals eat something only if you leave
;; them alone together.  If you're there, everyone is safe.

;; "You" and the boat are essentially always together so we represent that as simply :boat.
;; Thus, having no passenger is the same as passager :boat.  Internally, the explicit :boat
;; seems more convenient than special handling for nil.  However, for the reported moves, I
;; think nil is clearer and therefore we don't expose :boat as a "passenger".
